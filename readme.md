#Better Multi-Booting with BTRFS and Linux

This is a new (as of late 2023) paradigm for configuring a multi-boot Linux-only system. This was developed and refined within the threads of Kubuntu Forums discussions.

The benefits are improved hard disc space allocation and cross-distro file and application access. It will allow you to share files and applications across multiple
Linux distros on the same BTRFS partition.

This repo is divided into docs and scripts.

Docs explain the procedures to manually configure your system. The scripts do some of the work automatically and may require some additional configuration by the user.
